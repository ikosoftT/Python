# Python Common Core
## Modules py00 → py10

---

## Overview

The Python Common Core is a sequence of modules designed to introduce and strengthen programming fundamentals using the **Python programming language**.

These modules follow a **progressive learning path**, starting from basic syntax and moving toward more advanced concepts such as recursion, data structures, object-oriented programming, and problem solving.

Each module (`py00` to `py10`) contains exercises inspired by **real-world scenarios**, encouraging clean code, logical thinking, and good programming practices.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing all Python modules, you will:

- Understand Python syntax and semantics
- Learn how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Develop strong problem-solving skills
- Apply programming concepts to real-world problems
- Gain confidence to move into advanced programming topics

---

## Module Progression

### py00 — Python Basics
- Variables and data types
- Input / output
- Basic arithmetic
- Simple scripts

### py01 — Control Flow
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Logical operators
- Simple decision making

### py02 — Loops
- `for` and `while` loops
- Iteration logic
- Loop control statements

### py03 — Functions
- Function definitions
- Parameters and return values
- Scope and reusability

### py04 — Recursion
- Recursive thinking
- Base cases
- Stack behavior

### py05 — Strings and Collections
- Strings
- Lists and tuples
- Basic manipulation

### py06 — Dictionaries and Sets
- Key–value data structures
- Searching and filtering
- Practical use cases

### py07 — File Handling
- Reading and writing files
- Error handling
- Working with external data

### py08 — Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Attributes and methods
- Encapsulation

### py09 — Advanced OOP
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Code organization

### py10 — Final Concepts & Projects
- Combined concepts
- Mini-projects
- Clean architecture and best practices

---

## Structure

- Each module contains multiple exercises
- Exercises increase in difficulty
- Clear constraints and objectives
- Emphasis on logic over libraries

---

## Rules & Guidelines

- Follow Python best practices
- Write readable and well-structured code
- No unnecessary libraries unless allowed
- Respect the subject requirements

---

## Goal

The ultimate goal of these modules is to build a **strong programming foundation** in Python, preparing students for more advanced projects inside the 42 Common Core and beyond.
